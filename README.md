# Learning-machine-learning

This repository is designed to be a future source of the fundamental concepts concerning Machine Learning technics. The contents are divided into the basic concepts, providing state-of-art code for some models found in `Fundamental-concepts` folder, whereas in `Hands-on-ML` modern ML tools (Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras) are explored (based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow").

Brief description of the Jupyter notebooks in the `Fundamental-concepts`:

- `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`: explains how to implement a cost function to fit data to a linear model (also using scikit-learn)
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: the same of latter notebook, but using multiple features
- `linear_logistic_regression.ipynb`: apply the linear logistic regression for classification
- `polinomial_logistic_regression.ipynb`: same as latter, but for polinomial logistic regression
- `neurons_and_layers_tensorflow.ipynb`: shows the concepts of units and layers with tensorflow
- `neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb`: implpementation from the scratch of a simple neural network
- `binary_digit_classification.ipynb`: use neural networks with tensorflow and keras to recognize handwritten 0 and 1 images
- `multi_class_digit_classification.ipynb`: same as latter, but for digits from 0 to 9
- `decision_trees.ipynb`: classification of credit score (Poor, Standard and Good) using a decision trees, random forest and XGBoost

In the `Hands-on-ML` it is provided a series of notebooks using more suited ML tools (Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras) with similar but more extensive topics.
