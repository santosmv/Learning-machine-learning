# Learning-machine-learning

This repository is designed to be a future source of concepts concerning basic Machine Learning technics, applied over simple problems. A list of contents of notebooks to be mentioned is:

- `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`: explains how to implement a cost function to fit data to a linear model (also using scikit-learn)
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: the same of latter notebook, but using multiple features
- `linear_logistic_regression.ipynb`: apply the linear logistic regression for classification
- `polinomial_logistic_regression.ipynb`: same as latter, but for polinomial logistic regression
- `neurons_and_layers_tensorflow.ipynb`: shows the conepts of units and layers with tensorflow
- `neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb`: implpementation from the scratch of a simple neural network
- `binary_digit_recognition.ipynb`: use neural networks with tensorflow and keras to recognize handwritten 0 and 1 images
- `multi_class_digit_recognition.ipynb`: same as latter, but for digits from 0 to 9
